User-driven platform for getting home-cooked meals. 

The web app can be accessed here [SharEat](http://shareat-us.com)

# Tech Stack:

  Front-end: 

    React || Redux || HTML5 || CSS3 || Sass || React-bootstrap || Webpack build system

  Back-end:

    Node || MySql || Sequalize || Socket.io


# Getting Started

Simply fork the repo or clone. To run the app locally, you will need to install packages from NPM. 

To run the server, run node server/server.js from the CLI.

You will also need to run webpack. (We recommend using webpack -watch or -w from the root)


# Pull Requests
 
Pull requests must come from your own fork. You can submit a pull request to the dev branch. Remember to rebase before you submit. Merge conflicts will result in a declined pull request.

Recommended workflow:

Set up a remote (We prefer calling it upstream)

create your own branch

When your code is ready, rebase. Fix all merge conflicts.

Once merge conflicts are all set, merge into dev and push!

Any questions about workflow can be directed to psbyron3@gmail.com.

# That's It!

We hope you enjoy our app! Feel free to offer up any suggestions!
